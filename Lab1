Lab 1 — IAM: Users, Groups, and Policies

Overview/Goal

    Understand AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) by creating users and groups, inspecting and applying policies, and testing sign-in and permission behavior

For this lab, I:

    Created IAM groups (e.g., Developers, Admins) and IAM users (e.g., alice-dev, bob-admin)
    
    Attached managed and inline policies to groups to control service access (e.g., read-only S3, limited DynamoDB access)
    
    Added users to groups and verified effective permissions via the AWS Management Console
    
    Located and used the account-specific IAM Sign-in URL for console sign-in testing
    
    Experimented with policy changes and observed how they affected service access (DENY vs ALLOW precedence)
    
    Cleaned up by removing test users/groups and policies
