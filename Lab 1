***Lab 1 — IAM: Users, Groups, and Policies***



Overview/Goal:

    Understand AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) by creating users and groups, inspecting and applying policies, and testing sign-in and permission behavior

For this lab, I:

    1. Created IAM groups (e.g., Developers, Admins) and IAM users (e.g., alice-dev, bob-admin)
    
    2. Attached managed and inline policies to groups to control service access (e.g., read-only S3, limited DynamoDB access)
    
    3. Added users to groups and verified effective permissions via the AWS Management Console
    
    4. Located and used the account-specific IAM Sign-in URL for console sign-in testing
    
    5. Experimented with policy changes and observed how they affected service access (DENY vs ALLOW precedence)
    
    6. Cleaned up by removing test users/groups and policies

Skills Demonstrated:

    IAM Concepts (users, groups, policies, roles), Policy Authoring, Principle of Least Privilege, and Practical Permission Debugging.

Try it Yourself: 

    1. Sign in to AWS Console (use a sandboxed account).
    
    2. Create groups/users, attach policies, test sign-in using the IAM sign-in URL.
    
    3. Observe permission changes and remove test resources afterwards.
