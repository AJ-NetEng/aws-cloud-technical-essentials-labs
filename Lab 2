**Lab 2 — VPC: Multi-AZ VPC with Public & Private Subnets**



Overview/Goal:

    Build a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) spanning two Availability Zones, create public and private subnets, attach an Internet Gateway, configure route tables, and secure traffic with Network ACLs and Security Groups.

In this lab, I:

    1. Created a new VPC (CIDR e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
    
    2. Created two Availability Zones (AZ-A, AZ-B) subnets in each AZ:
    
              (i) Public Subnets: 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24
              
             (ii) Private Subnets: 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24
    
    3. Created and attached an Internet Gateway (IGW) to the VPC
    
    4. Created route table for public subnets and associated it with the public subnets (route 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW)
    
    5. Configured Security Groups for EC2 instances (e.g., allow SSH from my IP to bastion host; allow HTTP from ALB)
    
    6. Configured Network ACLs to show stateless packet filtering (example: Deny a test port at NACL level to see effect)
    
    7. Launched EC2 instances into subnets and tested connectivity (public instance reachable from internet, private instance reachable only from bastion in public subnet)

Skills Demonstrated:

    VPC design, Subnetting across AZs, Routing, Internet Gateway, Security Groups vs NACLs, and Testing Network Connectivity

Try it Yourself:

    1. From Console or AWS CLI, create VPC → subnets → IGW → route tables
  
    2. Launch EC2 instances in public and private subnets and test connectivity via SSH and HTTP
    
    3. Tweak NACL and SG rules to observe traffic changes
