# AWS Cloud Technical Essentials — Hands-on Labs

This repository documents the hands-on labs I completed as part of the **AWS Cloud Technical Essentials** course on Coursera. The labs demonstrate practical experience with IAM, VPC design, S3/DynamoDB integration, and high-availability patterns.


AWS is a market-leading cloud platform with a vast, mature service catalogue, global infrastructure, and strong security and compliance practices—making it ideal for everything from prototypes to enterprise workloads. Learning AWS gives you practical access to industry-standard tools (compute, networking, storage, IAM, monitoring) and a large ecosystem of employers, partners and learning resources, which makes your cloud skills both practical and highly marketable.

## Labs

- **Lab 2 — VPC with Public & Private Subnets (Multi-AZ)**
