***Lab 4 — High Availability (HA) for Your Application***



Overview/Goal:

    Implement high availability for a web application using multi-AZ deployment, load balancing and auto-scaling (or multi-target approach as provided in the lab)

In this lab, I: 

    1. Deployed the application across multiple Availability Zones (EC2 instances in different AZs or multiple targets behind a load balancer)
    
    2. Set up an Elastic Load Balancer (Application Load Balancer) and target group, registered instances
    
    3. Configured Auto Scaling Group with minimum and maximum instance counts and scale policies (e.g., based on CPU or request count)
    
    4. Configured health checks on the ALB to remove unhealthy instances automatically
    
    5. Verified HA behavior by:
    
              (i) Simulating instance failure (stop instance) and observing requests routed to healthy instances
              
             (ii) Generating traffic to test scaling behavior 
    
    6. Optionally configured RDS or DynamoDB (managed services) across AZs for database HA if included

Skills Demonstrated:

    Load Balancing (ALB), Auto Scaling, Multi-AZ Deployment Patterns, Health Checks, and Basic Resilience Testing

Try it Yourself:

    1. Create ALB and target group, launch EC2 instances across AZs and register with target group
    
    2. Create Auto Scaling Group with desired scaling policies and verify automatic replacement of unhealthy instances
